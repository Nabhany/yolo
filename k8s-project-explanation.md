# Project explanation
This is a Kubernetes YAML manifest file defining several resources for a web application, including a MongoDB database deployment, a backend server deployment, a frontend client deployment, and network policies allowing traffic from specific pods.

# MongoDB database deployment
The first resource defined is a Service for the MongoDB database deployment with a name of "db" and port 27017. The Service selects pods labeled with "app: mongo".

Next, a Deployment is defined for the MongoDB database with the same name "db". The Deployment specifies a replica count of 1 and selects pods labeled with "app: mongo". The container in the pod is named "db" and runs the official MongoDB Docker image. The container also sets environment variables for the root username and password and mounts a volume at "/data/db" to persist data.

# Service for the backend server
After the database deployment, a Service for the backend server is defined with the name "server" and port 5000. The Service selects pods labeled with "app: backend".

Then, a Deployment is defined for the backend server with the same name "server". The Deployment specifies a replica count of 1 and selects pods labeled with "app: backend". The container in the pod is named "server" and runs a Docker image tagged as "maamun/backend-docker:v1.0.0". The container sets an environment variable for the MongoDB database URL and exposes port 5000.

# Service for the frontend client
Next, a Service for the frontend client is defined with the name "client" and port 3000. The Service selects pods labeled with "app: frontend".

Finally, a Deployment is defined for the frontend client with the same name "client". The Deployment specifies a replica count of 1 and selects pods labeled with "app: frontend". The container in the pod is named "client" and runs a Docker image tagged as "maamun/client-docker:v1.0.0". The container exposes port 3000 and depends on the "server" deployment to be ready before starting.

# NetworkPolicy 
The last resource defined is a NetworkPolicy named "allow-from-yolo-project-network" which allows ingress traffic from pods labeled with "app: frontend" and "app: backend" on ports 3000 and 5000.
